## Project Description and Approach
This is my submission for the course project. My chosen project case is the **Vigenere Cipher**. As stated in the prompt, it is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It does so via substitution, in which letters in a given phrase are substituted for others using a key, specifically doing so by implementing the algorithms provided in the prompt. 

My approach to this project was relatively straightforward: follow the prompt and provide what it asks in a simple and clean manner. While thinking of how best to accomplish this, I thought to create a basic menu, along with a list for convenience.

## Project Instructions
Upon opening the project, the user is greeted with a list followed by three options: **Encrypt**, **Decrypt**, and **Exit**. The list, empty to start but to be populated through usage, displays all previously encrypted messages and their keys. This of course is for convenience when testing and grading, and would not be included if this project was meant for high security applications.

To begin, simply choose an option:
- **Encrypt** prompts the user to enter a phrase to be encrypted and a key. Using these two pieces of information, the program will generate an encrypted phrase and store it (along with the key) in the aforementioned list. The user can continue to generate encrypted phrases until they wish to exit.
- **Decrypt** prompts the user to enter a phrase to be decrypted and a key. Using these two pieces of information, the program will decrypt the encrypted phrase and display it to the user. The user can continue to decrypt encrypted phrases until they wish to exit.
- **Exit** allows the user to quit the program, thanking them for their time and wishing them a nice day.
